# Fischer Family Photo App

## Overview
The Fischer Family Photo App is a full-stack web application that enables seamless sharing and filtering of family photos by date and individuals, improving user experience in photo organization. Demo site can be found https://brennan-fischer.github.io/photos/. 

This web application works in conjunction with a Photo Metadata database created by my photo facial recognition sorting application found at https://github.com/Brennan-Fischer/Photo-Facial-Recognition-Sorting.  I would reccomend starting with that application first for any implementation. 

## Features
Facial Recognition: Automatically tags family members in photos.
Searchable Database: Allows users to search for photos by family member.
Tech Stack: Utilizes Blazor, C#, Azure SQL Database, and third-party APIs.

## Setup

First establish photo metadata database via https://github.com/Brennan-Fischer/Photo-Facial-Recognition-Sorting

Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/Brennan-Fischer/Fischer-Family-Photo-App.git
Open the solution in Visual Studio.
Restore NuGet packages.
Update the connection strings in appsettings.json.
Run the application.

## Usage
Use the search functionality to find photos based on tags.
